On March 28, 2013, the Miami University colony of Theta Tau partnered with the Talawanda Middle School for a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Outreach. The brothers held an after-school session that helped engage a young group of students in activities involving math and science. Some of these activities involved a competition to create the tallest standing structure out of balloons, and a boat-building competition using tin foil and pennies. 

Feedback from this event was generally negative. There were many obstacles that got in the way of planning the event such as scheduling conflicts, snow days, and an overall lack of communication from the teachers. Once the event was finally planned, there were only a handful of students that participated, and the faculty and teachers were generally disengaged. Some suggestions in the future were to plan the event at an earlier date to ensure preparation, to plan the activities based upon the material the students were learning in their classes, and to get the teachers more involved. While there were some obvious issues, many of the brothers still expressed interest to hold another STEM Outreach within the next year if the previous changes are made.
