On March 23, 2013, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau partnered with the humanitarian organization, Feed My Starving Children (FMSC), for its first 
service event of 2013. 
Members of Theta Tau volunteered at a variety of positions – all of which contributed to FMSC’s goal to create conveniently packaged food and nutrition options for poverty-stricken children around the globe. 
The event proved to be both a successful act of community service as well as a chance for the members of Theta Tau to strengthen their fraternal bonds through charity and cooperation. 
xTogether with other volunteering individuals from the community of Oxford, the colony of Theta Tau was able to package over 45,000 meals for starving children – contributing greatly to the total amount of meals packaged in total that day. 

Feedback on the event from the members of the fraternity was encouraging. 
Many of them felt that the event was enriching on a level of fraternal production as well as personal satisfaction – an overall positive approach to a service event. 
Additionally, every member of the fraternity signified that they would like to build and maintain a bond between the colony of Theta Tau and FMSC. 
Seeing as Miami University has its own active branch of FMSC (MUFMSC), this type of bond seems like a feasible reality for the colony of Theta Tau.
