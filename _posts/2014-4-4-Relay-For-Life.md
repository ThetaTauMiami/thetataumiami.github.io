On April 4, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau participated in Miami 
Universityâ€™s Relay for Life. Relay for Life is a 24-hour walk that raises money the American
Cancer Society. Theta Tau formed a team and raised money for this event. The brothers 
took turns walking around the track at Yager Stadium for the 24 hours. Our team raised 
$80 for the American Caner Society, and the entire event raised over $19,000. 

This was not a mandatory service event, so about half of the brothers signed up. 
The weather was not ideal for the walk so it did not make it very fun. Also this is not a very 
large event on our campus so there are not a lot of events going on during the later hours of 
the walk. The brothers had mix feelings on whether they thought it was a successful event 
and whether they would want to do it again.
