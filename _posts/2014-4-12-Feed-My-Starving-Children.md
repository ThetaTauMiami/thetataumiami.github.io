On April 12, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau participated in Miami
Universityâ€™s Feed My Starving Children. Feed My Starving children raise money to buy 
meal packs and then has volunteers help pack the meals. These meals are then mailed to 
developing countries. The meals have all the nutrients needed for a healthy, nutritious 
meal. The brothers fundraised and helped pack meals. The meals that were packed were 
sent to Nicaragua and Haiti. This event packed over 108,000 meals. 

Another club at Miami hosts this event, so we had no control over the date, which 
made it difficult for everyone to attend. This is the second year that the colony participated 
in this event, and all the brothers liked the event and would like to participate again. Next 
year the colony wants to raise more money to help the event be successful. Overall it was a 
successful service event.
