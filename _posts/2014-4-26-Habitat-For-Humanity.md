On April 26, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau partnered with 
the Cincinnati branch of Habitat for Humanity to provide service to the community of 
Cincinnati, Ohio. The service was split into two shifts in order to maximize the amount of 
work provided by the members of the colony. The brothers took part in the development 
of a house. With the help of the volunteers from Habitat for Humanity, many of the 
brothers participated in general cleanup of the construction site to ensure a safe working 
environment, while others painted the house. Over the course of the day the brothers were 
able to make significant contributions.

This was the second time the colony participated in Habitat for Humanity. Overall it 
was a successful event. The brothers enjoy this event and like helping with the community. 
Many brothers wish it was two days and they can choose between the two, like it was in the 
fall. This was a successful event and we hope to do it every semester.
