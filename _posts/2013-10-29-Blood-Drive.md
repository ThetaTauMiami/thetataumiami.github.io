On October 29, 2013, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau partnered
with MEDLIFE, NAACP, and Alpha Gamma Delta to co-sponsor a blood drive for the 
Community Blood Center. Leading up to this event, the brothers of Theta Tau 
promoted awareness for the drive and recruited donors. On the day of the blood 
drive, many brothers personally donated blood as well.

Feedback for this event was somewhat conflicting. Although it ended up 
being a success, progress for it began quite slowly. Toward the beginning, the 
number of registered donors was too low for the event to go through, and 
cancellation was considered. However, in the end, the required amount of donors 
was reached, and greatly exceeded. The rise in contribution from the brothers of 
Theta Tau is owed in part to a tremendous amount of work put in by the colonyâ€™s 
Service branch.

Moving forward, blood drives look to be a promising way for Theta Tau to 
promote cancer awareness and serve the community.
