On October 19, 2013, members of the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau 
were given a behind-the-scenes tour of the Kings Island amusement park, to 
promote the professional development of the fraternity. Brothers that attended 
were given a comprehensive tour of the park and received information about the 
feats of engineering required to design and orchestrate such a large amusement 
park. Brothers were also given the rare opportunity to meet with the engineer and 
designer of The Beast, the former fastest, longest, and tallest wooden roller coaster 
in the world.

Feedback from this event was positive. The attending brothers felt that tour 
was a great experience and a real opportunity to engineering at work. However, 
there were a few scheduling conflicts during this event. At the time of planning, the 
colony was also in the middle of planning a visit to Theta Tau’s National Conference. 
Because of the projected dates of the conference, the Kings Island visit was pushed 
to October 19, which also happened to be Miami University’s Homecoming 
weekend. Therefore attendance was at a minimum for the tour. Members agreed 
that they would like to participate in this tour again. But moving forward, they 
suggested that it be scheduled further in advanced.
