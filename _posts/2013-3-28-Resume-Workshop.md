On March 28, 2013, the Miami University colony of Theta Tau held a résuméworkshop on Miami’s campus. A booth was set up in the main lobby of Benton Hall, and the brothers of Theta Tau registered for time slots to operate it. While working the booth, brothers provided students with constructive advice and information on how to formulate a strong résumé. Students were free to bring in copies of their résumés for editing, or simply pick up an informational handout. 

Feedback from this event was very constructive. All the brothers that participated agreed that this was an effective event, but there were a few suggestions. One of the main concerns was the timing of the event. The colony came to the consensus that in the future, a résumé workshop should be held at a better time of the year, such as the Fall semester (before students begin applying for internships), or a few weeks before a major career fair. Also, it was agreed that there should be a larger emphasis on advertising for the events. Finally, more informational handouts should be printed off – of the twenty printed, all were taken. Moving forward, this workshop looks to be a promising event for professional development and, with proper advertising and promotion, a way to popularize our fraternity.
