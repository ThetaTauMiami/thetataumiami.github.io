On September 29, 2013, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau partnered 
with the Cincinnati Redsâ€™ organization to provide voluntary service at their home 
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The brothers of Theta Tau worked closely with 
the maintenance crew and employees of the Great American Ball Park to help clean 
the stadium during the 7th inning, In return for their service, the brothers were
given free admission to the game. 

Feedback from this event was positive. Many members enjoyed attending the 
game, claiming that it added a social aspect to the event. However, there were a few 
complaints that the actual work being done was not substantial enough. Given the 
popularity and convenience of Reds games, this type of service event proves to be a 
viable one moving forward. As our fraternity continues to grow, it will even be 
possible to organize larger events of service with the Reds organization.
