On February 17, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau showed the
Rube Goldberg machine at Theta Tau’s table at Engineer’s week. The Rube Goldberg 
machine was a Beta class pledge project. The Rube Goldberg machine had some Theta Tau 
ideas in it, such as a hammer and a pillar of knowledge. During Engineer’s week, Theta Tau 
had a table set up with members stationed at the table. The brothers explained the Rube 
Goldberg to other Miami students and future Miami students.

The brothers that worked on the Rube Goldberg machine thought it was a great 
pledge class project. They also thought that it was a great bonding experience for all that 
worked on the project. However, only 6 Beta class brothers worked on the project so they 
felt like they did not have enough members working on it. They also felt very rushed since 
they only had about a week to plan a build the machine. Majority of the brothers that 
worked on the project would like to do it again.
