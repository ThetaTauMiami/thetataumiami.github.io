On November 6, 2013, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau partnered
with the Oxfordâ€™s local frozen yogurt shop, Orange Leaf, to raise fraternity funds. As 
a part of the fundraiser, custom coupons were developed. These coupons ensured 
Theta Tau ten percent of every transaction made (given that the coupon was 
presented upon the transaction). This event was conducted based on a series of 
time slots, which brothers signed up for. During these time slots, brothers would 
stand outside of Orange Leaf and pass coupons out to customers. 

The feedback from this event was positive. Many members felt that the 
fundraiser was a simple and effective way to gather money. However, many of them 
felt that in the future this event should be moved to an earlier date, when Orange 
Leaf is receiving better business. Although the exact amount of funds raised has not 
been reported yet, this event seems to have been a success.
