On February 21, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau visited Talawanda
Middle School for STEM Outreach. STEM Outreach teaches young students about science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics in a fun way. The students participated in 
different activities such as making silly putty (from glue and liquid starch), making the 
tallest structure out of toothpicks and marshmallows, and making a structure that can 
support a full can of coke (using string, construction paper, paper clips and tape).

This was a very successful event. The brothers loved to see the students engaging 
in science and engineering. The students also really enjoyed learning about science and 
how science can be fun. The brothers enjoyed the event, but they would like an activity 
next time that is not messy. They did not like the mess that the silly putty made. The 
colony has been invited back to do another STEM Outreach looking Dan we look forward to 
participating again.
