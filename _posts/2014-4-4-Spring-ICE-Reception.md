On February 4, 2014, the Miami University Colony of Theta Tau hosted companies 
for a reception after Spring ICE. The professional development committee emailed the 
engineering companies that attended the career fair to invite them to the reception, with 
companies Marathon and Avery Dennison attending. Unfortunately, due to inclement 
weather many companies were unable to attend.

Overall the event was a success, with two brothers even earning summer 
internships from it. Everyone agreed that it was a great networking opportunity and that 
is was a great practice on how to interact with businesses in a less formal setting. Another 
suggestion for the event is to have it at a bar uptown instead of at the Shriver Student 
Center. Everyone would love to continue this event and looks forward to it growing in the
future.
