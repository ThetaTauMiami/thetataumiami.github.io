On September 23, 2013, the Miami University colony of Theta Tau attended,
“How the MythBusters Made Science Cool Again,” a lecture from Kari Byron and Tori 
Belleci, two cast members from Discovery’s MythBusters. The lecture was 
sponsored by the Miami University Lecture Series, and was open to Miami 
University students. During the lecture Kari and Tori discussed their passion for 
science, the paths they chose that led them to becoming MythBusters, and why 
science is such an important part of society. To close the event, Kari and Tori 
opened the discussion up to the audience, allowing for a question-and-answer 
session. This lecture was extremely successful in develop the professional 
development of our brothers because it contained insight from two individuals that 
took completely different (and arguably unorthodox) routes to success. Their 
overlying messages about creativity and persistence were something our brothers 
could truly learn from. 

The feedback for this event was extremely positive. Much like the last lecture 
our colony attended, “Neil deGrasse Tyson: Science as a Way of Knowing” (which 
was one of the main reasons we sought to attend this one), our members came away 
feeling completely inspired. Moving forward, our colony will continue to attend 
lectures of this nature.
