On October 26 and November 2, 2013, the Miami University Colony of Theta 
Tau partnered with the Eaton branch of Habitat for Humanity to provide service to 
the community of Eaton, Ohio. The service was split into two separate days – each 
with a morning and afternoon shift – in order to maximize the amount of work 
provided by the members of the colony. The brothers (as well as a fair amount of 
pledges) took part in the development of a house. With the help of the volunteers 
from Habitat for Humanity, many of the brothers installed dry wall on the ceilings 
and walls of the structure and cut slots out for the installation of windows and 
electrical outlets, while others participated in general cleanup of the construction 
site to ensure a safe working environment. Over the course of the four shifts 
completed, the brothers were able to make significant contributions.

The feedback from this event was extremely positive. This event was the first 
to involve participation from our recent pledges, and it served as a powerful 
bonding experience between them and the current brothers. Given that Habitat for 
Humanity is the national Philanthropy of Theta Tau, our colony will be looking to 
continue working with their Eaton branch in the future.
