Since their certification on January 26, 2013, the members of the Miami 
University colony of Mu Theta Tau have been working diligently to establish 
themselves as an influential organization – both within Miami University and the 
community of Oxford, OH. Prior to its colonization, Mu Theta Tau was already quite 
active in Miami University’s engineering community, participating in Bridge the Gap, 
a design project hosted by Miami Engineering Council, sponsoring an internship 
information session, and beginning its recruitment process for new members. After 
welcoming their first official pledge class on February 15, 2013, the colony of Mu 
Theta Tau was able to expand to twenty-nine current members – adding eleven new 
pledges of varying classes and disciplines of engineering. 

After a successful showcase at Miami University’s E-week open house, the 
colony of Mu Theta Tau is working toward moving forward in their process of 
becoming an official chapter of Theta Tau. Currently, they are finalizing plans for a 
STEM outreach program at a local middle school, where they hope to share the 
power of engineering with the community’s youth. They are also working closely 
with non-profit organizations such as Feed my Starving Children and Habitat for 
Humanity, in order to develop opportunities for local and national community 
service. The colony of Mu Theta Tau is also looking forward to their upcoming 
fundraiser opportunities: the Miami University Relay for Life, a charitable event for 
the American Cancer Society; and the Theta Tau March Madness bracket fundraiser. 

Along with its plans for community and charity services, the colony of Mu 
Theta Tau is also looking forward to expanding socially. Recently, members 
attended a Theta Tau formal, hosted by the University of Cincinnati’s Iota Gamma 
chapter. In addition, the colony is currently in the process of drafting and registering 
an intramural Ultimate Frisbee team to compete with the student body of Miami 
University. 

Mu Theta Tau is honored to be a certified colony of Theta Tau and prepared 
to make its first year one of professionalism and proficiency.
