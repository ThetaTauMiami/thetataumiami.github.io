      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Since our certification as a colony in January 2013, the &Tau;&Delta; Chapter of &Theta;&Tau; has grown to over 50 members.
        We have dedicated ourselves to the service of the College of Engineering and Computing as well as the greater Oxford community.
        We have participated in service events with national charities such as Habitat for Humanity, Feed My Starving Children, and Relay for Life, as well as local organizations such as an animal shelter and the Cincinnati Reds.
        We have worked with the College of Engineering and Computing on events such as Engineers' Week, Make It Miami tours, and led tutoring sessions for engineering students in any classes.
