	  <p>
	    Since our certification as a colony on January 26, 2013 and initiation 
            as a chapter on December 13, 2014, the members of the 
	    Tau Delta Chapter of Theta Tau have been working diligently 
	    to establish our selves as an influential organization - both within 
	    Miami University and the community of Oxford, OH. As engineers, our 
	    members understand that it is our civic duty to serve and inspire 
	    those around us.

	    <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Professional Development
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	    Our vision as a fraternity is to create an environment in which our 
	    members can exercise their natural skills as students and leaders, 
	    while also developing their skills as future employees. With a unique 
	    professional emphasis on both the present and the future, we allow for 
	    our members to focus on today, but prepare for tomorrow.

	    <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> Brotherhood
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	    Our members pride themselves upon sharing a brotherhood unlike any other
	    - one built around academic achievement, professional preparation, and 
	    a mutual desire for success. With all of this brotherhood comes the 
	    development of lasting friendships that not only strengthen the achievements 
	    of our fraternity, but foster a mindset of social activism, which allows for 
	    our brothers to branch out and succeed not only in the classroom and the 
	    workplace, but everywhere they go.
